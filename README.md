NoSQL Fitness Tracker Application

This Fitness Tracker application is designed to help you manage your workout routines on a regular bases. You can use it to store and review any exercise routine you have done, and observe them collectively on a series of charts to help gauge your progress.

# How it Works
When you navigate to the tracker homepage, you will be prompted to either create a new workout, or to continue a workout already in progress.
- Click New Workout, and you will be prompted to select your exercise type (either Resistance or Cardio).
- When you select your exercise type, you will then be prompted to fill out a form containing details about your current workout (for Resistance, for example, you will be prompted for things like Number of Sets, Number of Reps, and Resistance Weight)
- When you complete your form, you will be prompted to either add a new exercise to your routine, or to complete your workout. When you see the "Workout added successfully" message, you will know your routine has been saved.
- If you return to the homepage, you will see displayed the last workout routine you entered. From here, you can click the Dashboard link to show two charts:
- The first chart, a line graph, displays the cumulative duration of each of your workouts so you can see your progress over time.
- The second chart, a bar graph, displays the pounds of resistance in each of your workouts so you can see your progress over time.
